# House Price Prediction Project 🏠📊

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust house price prediction model for the Bengaluru real estate market. Through a comprehensive analysis of house-related data, the project explores and identifies key factors influencing property values, leveraging various data science techniques. This includes rigorous data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, advanced statistical analysis, and machine learning model development. The ultimate goal is to uncover significant trends, correlations, and patterns within house attributes, providing actionable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts to make informed decisions.

## Key Features 🌟

* **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented advanced techniques for handling missing values and outliers, alongside transforming raw data (e.g., converting 'total\_sqft' ranges, extracting BHK, and dimensionality reduction for 'location') into a clean, usable format. 🧹
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted detailed analysis on crucial features such as house price, area type, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and specific locations to understand their distributions and relationships. 🔍
* **Visualization:** Utilized powerful data visualization tools to effectively represent underlying trends, patterns, and correlations between different variables, aiding in outlier identification and feature understanding. 📈
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Trained and evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression, to accurately predict house prices. The project also incorporates hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for optimal model selection. 🧠
* **Predictive Insights:** Generated meaningful conclusions regarding factors that significantly influence house pricing, and provided a functional model to predict property values based on specified attributes. 💡

## Technologies Used 💻

* **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn 📊
* **Data Analysis Environment:** Jupyter Notebook 📓
